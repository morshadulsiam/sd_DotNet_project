                      <p>
                        At PetHub, we understand the deep bond between humans and their pets. This connection is beautifully encapsulated in several quotes that inspire us daily:

                          <li>"Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened." — Anatole France</li>
                          <li>"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated." — Mahatma Gandhi</li>
                          <li>"Animals are such agreeable friends—they ask no questions; they pass no criticisms." — George Eliot</li>
                          <li>"Pets understand humans better than humans do." — Ruchi Prabhu</li>
                          <li>"A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself." — Josh Billings</li>
                          <br>
                        These quotes reflect the profound impact pets have on our lives. They bring joy, offer unconditional love, and teach us valuable lessons about compassion and empathy. At PetHub, we celebrate this special bond and strive to enhance it through our services and community engagement.
